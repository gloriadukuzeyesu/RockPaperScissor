# RockPaperScissor

A simple Rock paper scissors game.  A player user plays against the computer player. 

## How it works: 

1. User is prompted to enter letter r, or p or s. 

   Where

   * **s**  stands for scissors
   * **p** stands for paper
   * **r** stands for rock

2. The computer generates a random letter between **r**, **p**, **s**

3. If both user and computer provide the same letter, the game is a tie

4. Otherwise, the check is make to provide who wins

5. At the end of each round of game a player is asked if they wish to continue playing or not. If they don't want to continue, the game ends. 

6. There is a check in the game that verifies if the player enters the correct letters. In case the letter is not r or p or s. The user is asked to re enter a valid letter. The game proceeds if the use enters the correct letter. 

   

   Here is a snippet of how the game looks like.
